# Badminton Courts SG

![alt text](go_badminton.png)

Ever wanted to find a badminton court in Singapore, but ended up stuck manually clicking through every single venue just to check one date? Well, as an active Badminton player, I understand your struggle as Iâ€™ve been through that pain way too many times. But not to worry, I got you ðŸ˜‰.

Introducing a simple automation software written in the [Go](https://go.dev/) <img src="golang.png" width="30" height="30"/> programming language. It provides a compiled listing of Badminton courts around Singapore.

Check out the live webpage at https://badmintoncourts.sg. Currently, it only supports the following sources: **ActiveSG** and **OnePA**, with plans to extend to private courts soon :) _OH YEAH_, and guess what? It even comes with a map display for an easy and interactive location-based view!

> # **IMPORTANT NOTICE**

**`1.`** The main purpose of this program is to simplify the process of finding Badminton courts. There are **_NO intentions of causing harm or disruption_** to the external sources involved.

**`2.`** It **DOES NOT** (and never will) deal with booking of courts in any way

**`3.`** It is built with safety in mind, and extra precaution is taken to ensure that requests are limited, to reduce the stress on servers

**`4.`** There is only a **_SINGLE_** process at any point in time that is communicating with the external servers, while other concurrent processes will read data from a cached database file instead

- this single process limits the requests to a _maximum_ pool of _6-8 goroutines_, ensuring **_controlled_** and **_predictable_** traffic towards upstream external sources
- this prevents any form of disruption to the services

**`5.`** The program will only send a new batch of requests to the external servers after a period of time have passed (**10 minutes**), and would otherwise retrieve data from a cached database file instead

- in other words, the data is only refreshed at every fixed interval, preventing any form of spam request to the upstream source servers
